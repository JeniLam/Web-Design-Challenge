# Web-Design-Challenge

Web Visulatization Dashboard of the WeatherPY challenge.  Here weather from over 500 random cities across the globe at different latitudes relative to the equator were used.  The visualizations include latitude versus temperature, humidity, cloudiness and windspeed using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap.

Website Details:

A [landing page] containing:

- An explanation of the project.
- Links to each visualizations page.

Four [visualization pages] each with:
- A descriptive title and heading tag.
- The plot/visualization itself for the selected comparison.
- A paragraph describing the plot and its significance.

A ["Comparisons" page] that:

- Contains all of the visualizations on the same page so we can easily visually compare them.
- Uses a bootstrap grid for the visualizations.
- The grid must be two visualizations across on screens medium and larger, and 1 across on extra-small and small screens.

A ["Data" page] that:

- Displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations.
- The table must be a bootstrap table component.
- The data must come from exporting the .csv file as HTML, or converting it to HTML. Try using a tool you already know, pandas. Pandas has a nifty method approprately called to_html that allows you to generate a HTML table from a pandas dataframe. See the documentation here
